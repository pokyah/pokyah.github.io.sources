      <description>While working with geodata, you might often end up downloading large raw-data files likes .shp that you will need in your data process chain.

      <description>As a data scientist, you certainly produce a bunch of tables, plots, maps and many other kind of outputs to let your data “speak for itself”. This is your core business and I’m sure you do it pretty well ! But when it comes to make this data available to your target audience things can quickly get more frustrating. How to share these outputs in a format that everyone can open ?</description>
