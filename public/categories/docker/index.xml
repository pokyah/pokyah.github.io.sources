      <description>Write your shiny App as a package Building shiny apps as package will help you to produce a cleaner and easier to maintain code thanks to devtools and testthat. https://wlandau.github.io/2016/11/01/appPackage/. I heavily recommand you to code your app in this way. Doing so will also allow you to use devtools::install_github() to quickly install your app on any computer/server. R packages are the most efficient way to make reproductible science. Why ?</description>

      <description>Why should you do that ? There are two main reasons to use R in conjunction with Docker. First, it allows you to quickly and easily share your work wathever the OS and R configuration of your collaborators. Hassle free collaboration ! Second, it allows you to work in an isolated environment. This means that you will never pollute your OS and e.g.Â run in time-consuming re-installation procedures due to broken configuration.</description>
