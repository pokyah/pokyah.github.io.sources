      <description>Why this website ?A website is highly useful for yourself to keep track of what you have done and thought. Sometimes you may go back to a certain old post of yours to relearn the tricks or methods you once mastered in the past but have forgotten.
How is it built ?This website is built with R blogdown which uses a combination of Hugo, Rmarkdown and knitr.</description>
