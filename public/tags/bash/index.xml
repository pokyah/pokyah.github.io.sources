      <description>Each time you start a new R project, it is highly recommanded to prepare a clean and organized working directory
If you regularly create new projects, this working directory preparation task might seem tedious and time consuming. Creating the folders, intializing git, creating a license file, a readme file, etc.
Instead of copying/pasting an existing pristine directory tree, I propose you to use the power of linux bash scripting.
Iâ€™ve built a little script, inspired from frdvnw, that will allow you to quickly create a new R project directory tree along with all its commonly required files.</description>
