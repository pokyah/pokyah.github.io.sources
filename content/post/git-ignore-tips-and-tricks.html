<p>While working with geodata, you might often end up downloading large raw-data files likes <code>.shp</code> that you will need in your data process chain.</p>
<p>As you don’t want to keep this static files under version control, you must tell git to ignore these files. Usually, you do it by adding a rule to your <code>.gitignore</code> file. But what if those files were created before there were added to the <code>.gitignore</code> ?</p>
<p>This problem happened to me this morning. My usual R specific <code>.gitignore</code> file was not setup to ignore large <code>.shp</code> files and I inadvertently added my <code>.shp</code> files to git. After some local commits, I pushed my work to my online repo and as it took a longer time than usual to upload, I suspected that large files were polluting my git index.</p>
<p>So the first thing I did, is to add a “ignore the folder containing my geodata” rule to my <code>.gitignore</code> file : <code>geodata/</code>. To learn more about ignore folders, check <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14700835/gitignore-a-folder-content?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1">this</a> SO thread.</p>
<p>Then, because the ignoring rule was setup after those files were already added to my git index, I had to remove them from the cache :</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ git rm --cached &lt;FOLDER_NAME_OR_FILE_NAME&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This command was found on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2047465/how-can-i-delete-a-file-from-git-repo">this</a> SO thread</p>
<p>If you want to inspect which files of your project are ignored by git, run this command from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15931238/unable-to-remove-file-that-really-exists-fatal-pathspec-did-not-match-any#15931542">this</a> SO thread :</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ git ls-files --others -i --exclude-standard</code></pre>
<p>Finally, after adding the rule, and removing the files from my repository, I pushed again and ended up with the exact same problem : large files were being uploaded to my online repo. How could this be possible ? The problem, as mentioned in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19573031/cant-push-to-github-because-of-large-file-which-i-already-deleted#23657759">this</a> SO thread, was that the file was still in my history. So I simply executed this command to solve my problem :</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ git filter-branch --index-filter &#39;git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch &lt;file/dir&gt;&#39; HEAD</code></pre>
