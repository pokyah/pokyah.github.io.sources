<p>Each time you start a new R project, it is <strong>highly recommanded</strong> to prepare a clean and <a href="https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-05-17-organising-my-project/">organized working directory</a></p>
<p>If you regularly create new projects, this working directory preparation task might seem tedious and time consuming. Creating the folders, intializing git, creating a license file, a readme file, etc.</p>
<p>Instead of copying/pasting an existing pristine directory tree, I propose you to use the power of linux bash scripting.</p>
<p>I’ve built a little script, inspired from <a href="https://frdvnw.github.io/data-sciences/linux/2018/04/12/my-r-skeletton.html">frdvnw</a>, that will allow you to quickly create a new R project directory tree along with all its commonly required files.</p>
<p>So, what does the script actually do ?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It pulls the Github R .gitgnore template file and make it your .gitignore file</li>
<li>It pulls the GNU GPL V3 license from gnu.org and make it your LICENSE file</li>
<li>It pulls a default init.R script from its repo. This init.R file contains a YAML header + Terms of Services footer + my habitual R script initialization functions (load common libraries, etc…)</li>
<li>It creates the tree structure (data folder, output folder, img fodlers, etc)</li>
<li>It intialize a new git repository and make a first commit for you ;)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to give it a try, head at its <a href="https://github.com/pokyah/R-project-init">repo</a>, fork/clone and play it !</p>
