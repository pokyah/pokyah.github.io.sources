      <description>Introduction and contextThe aim of the Agromet project is to provide a near real-time hourly gridded datasets of weather parameters at the resolution of 1 kmÂ² for the whole region of Wallonia characterized by a quality indicator.
The Agromet project is largely inspired by what the ZEPP has developed in the context of their late blight warning services (see academic paper).
Before starting the development of our own service, we decided to submit a survey to our end users and to perform a preliminary benchmark of weather data interpolation facilities developed by other institutions.</description>
