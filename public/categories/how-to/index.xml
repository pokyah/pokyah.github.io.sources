      <description>Maintaining a blog allows you to keep track of what you have done and thought. When you don’t remember how did you succeed to find a solution to a tricky problem, browsing your old posts might help you. As a scientist, it’s also the perfect tool to communicate your results to a wider audience. Moreover it allows you to showcase your work and possibly get hired for a future project. Nowadays many tools exist for you to publish on the web.</description>

      <title>Producing and mapping gridded datasets with uncertainty using R</title>

      <description>In the context of the Agromet project, we need to produce gridded maps of temperature using data acquired by a network of 30 automatic weather stations (AWS) spatially distributed in Wallonia. To each cell, an indicator of uncertainty (i.e. prediction error) must also be attached. Providing this uncertainty is of major importance because errors are not likely to be spatially homogeneous but will rather depend of the spatial arrangement of available points used to compute the model.</description>

      <description>The AGROMET Project lead by the Walloon agricultural research center (CRA-W) requires to generate spatialized weather dataset. In this context, multiple spatialization methods will be tested and evaluated among which the multiple regression technique. This post provides an introductory material to the multiple regression modeling technique applied to spatial data. It is not a tutorial and it is rather aimed at paving the way for beginners who want to take their first steps into in the field of applied geostatistics (with R) by defining key concepts and providing a lot of external resources worth reading !</description>

      <description>As a data scientist, you certainly produce a bunch of tables, plots, maps and many other kind of outputs to let your data “speak for itself”. This is your core business and I’m sure you do it pretty well ! But when it comes to make this data available to your target audience things can quickly get more frustrating. How to share these outputs in a format that everyone can open ?</description>
