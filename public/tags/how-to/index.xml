      <description>ProblemYou need to convert a batch of .docx documents containing images to markdown files containing the images.
The solutionCreate a script that will parse all the docx files present in a specific folder
Do you need to batch convert a set a MS Office .docx files to markdown?
If you are a regular R user, you might find this script useful.

      <description>Here we demonstrate how to map the prediction together with the uncertainty in an intuitive and intelligible way. Our approach is based on this post by Tomislav Hengl and this post by Penn state college of earth and mineral sciences
# For the example, using the output of mlr gstat KED from previous section# loading datasetsdata(meuse)data(meuse.grid)# imputing values to missing datameuse = impute(meuse, classes = list(numeric = imputeMean(), factor = imputeMode()),dummy.</description>

      <description>Today I was looking for an high resolution Digital Elevation Model for a Region of Belgium. Until now, I was using the raster::getData(&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;, country = &amp;quot;BE&amp;quot;, mask = TRUE) which only provides a low resolution DEM (5 km).
The belgian National Geographic institute provides DEM’s at high resolution (80m and 20m). These are available from their download portal. Unfortunately I have not found yet a trick to download their data automatically (RSelenium?</description>

      <description>While working with geodata, you might often end up downloading large raw-data files likes .shp that you will need in your data process chain.
As you don’t want to keep this static files under version control, you must tell git to ignore these files. Usually, you do it by adding a rule to your .gitignore file. But what if those files were created before there were added to the .</description>

      <description>Each time you start a new R project, it is highly recommanded to prepare a clean and organized working directory
If you regularly create new projects, this working directory preparation task might seem tedious and time consuming. Creating the folders, intializing git, creating a license file, a readme file, etc.
Instead of copying/pasting an existing pristine directory tree, I propose you to use the power of linux bash scripting.</description>

      <title>How to quickly create and maintain a blog with R ?</title>
      <link>/post/quickly-create-and-maintain-a-blog-with-r/</link>

      <description>Maintaining a blog allows you to keep track of what you have done and thought. When you don’t remember how did you succeed to find a solution to a tricky problem, browsing your old posts might help you. As a scientist, it’s also the perfect tool to communicate your results to a wider audience. Moreover it allows you to showcase your work and possibly get hired for a future project.</description>

      <title>Producing and mapping gridded datasets with uncertainty using R</title>
      <link>/post/gridded-uncertainty/</link>

      <guid>/post/gridded-uncertainty/</guid>
      <description>In the context of the Agromet project, we need to produce gridded maps of temperature using data acquired by a network of 30 automatic weather stations (AWS) spatially distributed in Wallonia. To each cell, an indicator of uncertainty (i.e. prediction error) must also be attached. Providing this uncertainty is of major importance because errors are not likely to be spatially homogeneous but will rather depend of the spatial arrangement of available points used to compute the model.</description>

      <description>As a data scientist, you certainly produce a bunch of tables, plots, maps and many other kind of outputs to let your data “speak for itself”. This is your core business and I’m sure you do it pretty well ! But when it comes to make this data available to your target audience things can quickly get more frustrating. How to share these outputs in a format that everyone can open ?</description>

      <description>Why should you do that ? There are two main reasons to use R in conjunction with Docker. First, it allows you to quickly and easily share your work wathever the OS and R configuration of your collaborators. Hassle free collaboration ! Second, it allows you to work in an isolated environment. This means that you will never pollute your OS and e.g. run in time-consuming re-installation procedures due to broken configuration.</description>

      <description>Attempting to statistically assess the agreement level between two quantitative methods of measurements requires a validation tool.
A widely adopted tool is the correlation study computed with one method as predictor and the other as response variable (e.g. see this publication that compares temperature measurements obtained by two different kind of weather stations at the exact same location).
However, as described by Giavarina (2015), correlation study should not be used to asses the comparatibility or agreement between two instruments (because it studies the relation between one variable and the other and not the differences).</description>

      <description>Disposer d’un d’accès SSH vous permet de réellement avoir la main sur votre hébergement mutualisé (qui n’est rien d’autre qu’un accès limité à certains dossiers et programmes stockés sur un serveur tournant généralement sous Linux).
Grâce à votre accès SSH, vous pourrez notamment y exécuter des commandes unix et git directement depuis le terminal de votre ordinateur personnel. C’est l’outil idéal pour la maintenance de votre site WordPress par exemple !</description>
