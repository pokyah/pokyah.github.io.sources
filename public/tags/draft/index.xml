      <description>Today I was looking for an high resolution Digital Elevation Model for a Region of Belgium. Until now, I was using the raster::getData(&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;, country = &amp;quot;BE&amp;quot;, mask = TRUE) which only provides a low resolution DEM (5 km).
The belgian National Geographic institute provides DEMâ€™s at high resolution (80m and 20m). These are available from their download portal. Unfortunately I have not found yet a trick to download their data automatically (RSelenium?</description>

      <description>While working with geodata, you might often end up downloading large raw-data files likes .shp that you will need in your data process chain.
As you don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep this static files under version control, you must tell git to ignore these files. Usually, you do it by adding a rule to your .gitignore file. But what if those files were created before there were added to the .gitignore ?</description>
