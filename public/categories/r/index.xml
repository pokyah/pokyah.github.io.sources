      <description>Today I was looking for an high resolution Digital Elevation Model for a Region of Belgium. Until now, I was using the raster::getData(&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;, country = &amp;quot;BE&amp;quot;, mask = TRUE) which only provides a low resolution DEM (5 km).
The belgian National Geographic institute provides DEM’s at high resolution (80m and 20m). These are available from their download portal. Unfortunately I have not found yet a trick to download their data automatically (RSelenium?</description>

      <title>Quickly create your R project directory tree with pre-filled common files</title>

      <description>Each time you start a new R project, it is highly recommanded to prepare a clean and organized working directory
If you regularly create new projects, this working directory preparation task might seem tedious and time consuming. Creating the folders, intializing git, creating a license file, a readme file, etc.
Instead of copying/pasting an existing pristine directory tree, I propose you to use the power of linux bash scripting.
I’ve built a little script, inspired from frdvnw, that will allow you to quickly create a new R project directory tree along with all its commonly required files.</description>

      <title>Producing and mapping gridded datasets with uncertainty using R</title>

      <description>In the context of the Agromet project, we need to produce gridded maps of temperature using data acquired by a network of 30 automatic weather stations (AWS) spatially distributed in Wallonia. To each cell, an indicator of uncertainty (i.e. prediction error) must also be attached. Providing this uncertainty is of major importance because errors are not likely to be spatially homogeneous but will rather depend of the spatial arrangement of available points used to compute the model.</description>

      <description>The AGROMET Project lead by the Walloon agricultural research center (CRA-W) requires to generate spatialized weather dataset. In this context, multiple spatialization methods will be tested and evaluated among which the multiple regression technique. This post provides an introductory material to the multiple regression modeling technique applied to spatial data. It is not a tutorial and it is rather aimed at paving the way for beginners who want to take their first steps into in the field of applied geostatistics (with R) by defining key concepts and providing a lot of external resources worth reading !</description>

      <description>As a data scientist, you certainly produce a bunch of tables, plots, maps and many other kind of outputs to let your data “speak for itself”. This is your core business and I’m sure you do it pretty well ! But when it comes to make this data available to your target audience things can quickly get more frustrating. How to share these outputs in a format that everyone can open ?</description>

      <title>Using R with Docker</title>

      <description>Why should you do that ? There are two main reasons to use R in conjunction with Docker. First, it allows you to quickly and easily share your work wathever the OS and R configuration of your collaborators. Hassle free collaboration ! Second, it allows you to work in an isolated environment. This means that you will never pollute your OS and e.g. run in time-consuming re-installation procedures due to broken configuration.</description>

      <title>Assessing the agreement between two quantitative methods of measurements : understanding the Bland Altman analysis</title>

      <description>Attempting to statistically assess the agreement between two quantitative methods of measurements requires a validation tool.
A widely adopted tool is the correlation study computed with one method as predictor and the other as response variable (e.g. see this publication that compares temperature measurements obtained by two different kind of weather stations at the exact same location).
However, as described by Giavarina (2015), correlation study should not be used to asses the comparatibility or agreement between two instruments (because it studies the relation between one variable and the other and not the differences).</description>
